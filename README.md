# Hi 👋

### I'm a Software Engineer @[Siemens](https://www.siemens.com) & a Compiler Hacker @[OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)

- I’m currently contributing to the design system at [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com), the premier low-code IDE, as
a frontend engineer.
- While in my free time, I actively contribute to the [jank programming language](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank)
project in open source.

My interests are deeply rooted in exploring a philosophical approach to programming, as well as anything
related to developer tooling (IDEs, compilers, runtimes, systems programming, etc.). This makes contributing
to a low-code IDE (full-time) and a programming language a perfect fit for me.
