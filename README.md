# Hi 👋

### I'm a Software Engineer @[Siemens](https://www.siemens.com) & a Compiler Hacker @[OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)

- I’m currently contributing to the design system for [Studio Pro](https://www.mendix.com/platform/ide), the leading
low-code IDE, at [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com), a Siemens business, as a frontend engineer.
- While in my free time, I actively contribute to the [jank programming language](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank)
project in open source.

My interests are deeply rooted in exploring a philosophical approach to programming, as well as anything
related to developer tooling (IDEs, compilers, runtimes, systems programming, etc.).
